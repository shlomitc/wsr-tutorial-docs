# Layout

The backoffice design system heavily relies on the 12-column grid system, very similar to how `bootstrap` grid styles works. The grid is used for the main app layout and internal parts as well.

In this section we will learn about `Grid` and `Card` components.

#### Tutorial Tip
For the upcoming examples, you're advised to add some background color to your app, just to make things a bit more clear

Add to your `index.ejs`:

```css
<style>
  body {
    background-color: #f0f4f7;
  }
</style>
```

Start - [Grid](./Grid.md).
